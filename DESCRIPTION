Description: Computes the sample probability value (p-value) 
    for the estimated coefficient from a standard 
    genome-wide univariate regression.  It computes the exact 
    finite-sample p-value under the assumption that the measured 
    phenotype (the dependent variable in the regression) has 
    a known Bernoulli-normal mixture distribution. 
    Finite-sample genome-wide regression p-values (Gwrpv) with 
    a non-normally distributed phenotype (Gregory Connor and 
    Michael O'Neill, bioRxiv 204727 <doi:10.1101/204727>).
